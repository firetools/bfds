# BFDS repository

**BFDS** is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org) add-on that makes it easy to create and manage [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) models.

Instead of entering complex geometry by hand, you can use Blender’s powerful 3D tools to build and edit FDS entities directly in a familiar environment.

Designed for **fire safety engineers**, **researchers**, and **students**, BFDS helps you focus on your fire simulations instead of struggling with the geometry setup.

> **NIST FDS** is an open source large-eddy simulation (LES) code for simulating low-speed flows, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

> **BFDS** is the successor to the **BlenderFDS** project — a community-driven initiative first presented at the [Blender Conference 2009](https://www.academia.edu/10074830/Development_and_testing_of_BlenderFDS_the_open_community_based_user_interface_for_NIST_FDS) and continuously developed since then.

## How to install

Install BFDS from within Blender itself: browse the [Blender Extension portal](https://extensions.blender.org/), and search for `BFDS`.

## Other info

Run CI test with `pytest`.
